# Net-Core-Mvc-Angular
An ASP.NET Core MVC Feature SPA approach using Angular.

## Purpose
I've read multiple stackoverflow posts asking how to use Angular along side a server side client framework like Asp.Net MVC. Many of these questions are from people who simply want to provide an enhanced user experience for a specific feature in their Net MVC app. Unfortunately, many of the responses suggest to not use a framework like Angular along side another server side client framework. I've found an approach that is working well for me and my team, and I would like to share it with you.
